        <img src="assets/images/mypic.jpg" alt="Laura McSay">
        <p>Currently a beer buyer and Certified Cicerone for The Fifty/50 restaurant group, I’ve got over 7 years experience working in hospitality. In addition to designing the beer program for several restaurants in Chicago, I specialize in training staff, organizing and promoting events, and overseeing the quality of our products. I find the intricate history of beer fascinating and I enjoy educating the public on it’s backstory and impact on culture around the world.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for learning and developing new skills, always looking to build on my academic background in psychobiology. Most recently I’ve taken interest in web design and have started taking coding classes at Northwestern University. I hope to use my new expertise to contribute to organizations I’m passionate about and help them with the ever-evolving tech world.</p>
        <p>In my free time I enjoy being active in the outdoors. I recently ran my first half-marathon and hope to run another one this summer. I also love going to live music, reading non-fiction books, and traveling.</p>
